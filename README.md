Boot the emulator with an sdcard and install protected application.
Open logcat and monitor for the Application tag for the dalvikvm like this ![logcat](art/image.png), you will see created file name output here.
Then use adb to pull the file, `adb  pull /sdcard/pkg_classes_xxx.dex`<br>
Then run `java -jar Decoder.jar pkg_dexs_dir` to get all odex used from the unprotected file.
